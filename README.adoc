= Edster Application

Edster is an application based on JHipster, designed to create and generate presentations. It leverages the JHipster platform to quickly develop and deploy modern presentation generating applications.

== Generating the Codebase

The Edster codebase can be generated using the `jdl.sh` script. This script processes a JDL (JHipster Domain Language) file to define the application's entities, relationships, and configurations.

*Note: Before running the `jdl.sh` script for the first time, you need to make it executable using the following command:*

[source,bash]
----
chmod u+x jdl.sh
----

To generate the codebase:

. Execute the `jdl.sh` script:
+
[source,bash]
----
./jdl.sh
----

This command will:

*   Parse the JDL file.
*   Generate the necessary application code based on the JDL definition.

Ensure that you have the necessary JHipster environment set up.

== Cleaning the Generated Code

If you need to clean the generated code, you can use the `clean.sh` script.

*Note: Before running the `clean.sh` script for the first time, you need to make it executable using the following command:*

[source,bash]
----
chmod u+x clean.sh
----

To clean the generated code:

. Execute the `clean.sh` script:
+
[source,bash]
----
./clean.sh
----

This command will remove the generated code, allowing you to regenerate it using the `jdl.sh` script.

== Development Mode

To run the application in development mode, use the following steps:

. Start the development environment:
+
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew
----

This command will start the backend server with hot reloading enabled. The frontend is served by the webpack dev server.

. Access the application in your browser:
+
http://localhost:9000

. Development-specific configurations:
* Profile: `dev`
* Hot reloading for backend changes
* Webpack dev server for frontend
* H2 database (if not configured differently)

== Production Mode

To run the application in production mode, use the following steps:

. Build the production-ready package:
+
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew -Pprod clean build
----

This command will:

*   Compile the Java code
*   Run tests
*   Package the application into a deployable archive (`.war` or `.jar` or `.gradle` )
*   Optimize the frontend assets

. Run the application:
+
[source,bash]
----
java -jar build/libs/*.jar
----

This command will start the application using the production profile.

. Access the application in your browser:
+
http://localhost:8080

. Production-specific configurations:
* Profile: `prod`
* Optimized and minified frontend assets
* No hot reloading
* Production database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)

== Development Iteration

During development, you can run the backend and frontend separately for faster iteration.

. To run only the backend:
+
[source,bash]
----
pnpm run backend:start
----

This command will start the backend server.

. To run the frontend in watch mode:
+
[source,bash]
----
pnpm run start
----

This command will start the frontend development server with hot reloading, allowing you to see changes in real-time.

== Synchronizing the Codebase

The `sync.sh` script helps synchronize manual code changes with the JDL-generated codebase. This ensures that customizations are preserved when regenerating the application using `jdl.sh`.

*Note: Before running the `sync.sh` script for the first time, you need to make it executable using the following command:*

[source,bash]
----
chmod u+x sync.sh
----

To synchronize the codebase:

. Execute the `sync.sh` script:
+
[source,bash]
----
./sync.sh
----

This script will identify and merge your manual changes into the newly generated code, minimizing conflicts and preserving your customizations.
