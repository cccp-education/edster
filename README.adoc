= Edster Application

Edster is an application based on JHipster, designed to create and generate presentations. It leverages the JHipster platform to quickly develop and deploy modern presentation generating applications.

== Generating the Codebase

The Edster codebase can be generated using the `jdl.sh` script. This script processes a JDL (JHipster Domain Language) file to define the application's entities, relationships, and configurations.

*Note: Before running the `jdl.sh` script for the first time, you need to make it executable using the following command:*

[source,bash]
----
chmod u+x scripts/jdl.sh
----

To generate the codebase:

. Execute the `jdl.sh` script:
+
[source,bash]
----
./scripts/jdl.sh
----

This command will:

*   Parse the JDL file.
*   Generate the necessary application code based on the JDL definition.

Ensure that you have the necessary JHipster environment set up.

== Cleaning the Generated Code

If you need to clean the generated code, you can use the `clean.sh` script.

*Note: Before running the `clean.sh` script for the first time, you need to make it executable using the following command:*

[source,bash]
----
chmod u+x scripts/clean.sh
----

To clean the generated code:

. Execute the `clean.sh` script:
+
[source,bash]
----
./scripts/clean.sh
----

This command will remove the generated code, allowing you to regenerate it using the `jdl.sh` script.

== Development Mode

To run the application in development mode, use the following steps:

. Start the development environment:
+
[source,bash]
----
./npmw run app:start;
----

This command will start the backend server with hot reloading enabled. The frontend is served by the webpack dev server.

. Access the application in your browser:
+
http://localhost:8080

. Development-specific configurations:
* Profile: `dev`
* Hot reloading for backend changes
* Webpack dev server for frontend
* H2 database (if not configured differently)

== Production Mode

To run the application in production mode, use the following steps:

. Build the production-ready package:
+
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew -Pprod clean build
----

This command will:

*   Compile the Java code
*   Run tests
*   Package the application into a deployable archive (`.war` or `.jar` or `.gradle` )
*   Optimize the frontend assets

. Run the application:
+
[source,bash]
----
java -jar build/libs/edster-0.0.1.jar
----

CAUTION: The jar file name may vary depending on the version of the application.

This command will start the application using the production profile.

. Access the application in your browser:
+
http://localhost:8080/

. Production-specific configurations:
* Profile: `prod`
* Optimized and minified frontend assets
* No hot reloading
* Production database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)

== Development Iteration

During development, you can run the backend and frontend separately for faster iteration.

. To run only the backend:
+
[source,bash]
----
./npmw run backend:start;
----

This command will start the backend server on :
+
http://localhost:8080/

. To run the frontend in watch mode:
+
[source,bash]
----
./npmw run start;
----

This command will start the frontend development server with hot reloading, allowing you to see changes in real-time on :
+
http://localhost:9001/


== Synchronizing the Codebase

The `sync.sh` script helps synchronize manual code changes with the JDL-generated codebase. This ensures that customizations are preserved when regenerating the application using `jdl.sh`.

*Note: Before running the `sync.sh` script for the first time, you need to make it executable using the following command:*

[source,bash]
----
chmod u+x scripts/sync.sh
----

To synchronize the codebase:

. Execute the `sync.sh` script:
+
[source,bash]
----
./scripts/sync.sh
----

This script will identify and merge your manual changes into the newly generated code, minimizing conflicts and preserving your customizations.

=== Add an entry to .gitignore

==== Add the .goose folder to .gitignore

In order to add the .goose folder to .gitignore file, you must add this code at the end of the jdl.sh file

[source,bash]
----
echo ".goose" >> .gitignore;
----

=== Running the Application front and back end separately in development mode on one terminal.

To run the application front and back end separately in development mode on one terminal, you can use the following steps:
[source,bash]
----
./npmw run backend:start &;npm run start;
----

One ctrl+c will stop the front only. To stop backend, you will need to find the process id and kill it, like this :
[source,bash]
----
killall -9 java
----

To re-run the front end :
[source,bash]
----
npm run start;
----
